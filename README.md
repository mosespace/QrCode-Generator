Before you run the code, you need to have installed ```qrcode``` library
and to do that, 

```js:

```

## Process
After the installation of the library, Fork and clone this repository onto your local server.
> The next step will be to run the code suing your favouritte IDE. For my case i use vscode but you can use any of your choice. Run the code in the terminal and follow the simple instructed process.

## Download Processes
> NOTE
The process may differ on your internet. I would recommend you to make sure that your connected to a strong
and first network ortherwise. The download process won't slow down.

Finally the process can not take 0.5(sec) to 1(sec) for any website type to download the QrCode.
Otherwise you can find your download in that same very folder containing your src file or in the main folder
with the saved name type and extension. eg [qrcode.png](/qrCode.png).
> The quality of the downloaded QrCode should be the highest quality ever in all formats/types. How amazing is that?
